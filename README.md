# Code examples for Cognitive Services Quickstarts 

This repository contains the code examples used by the QuickStarts on the [Cognitive Services Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/)

## What are code examples

Code examples are a collection of snippets whose primary purpose is to be ingested by QuickStart documentation. This code can compile and run but not intended as a template for how a solution should be developed.

This code is ingested our documentation directly and intended to be read or used by themselves.

## Getting Started

These code snippets back Quickstarts found on [Cognitive Services Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/). These snippets are not intended as standalone code samples or for production use. To learn how to use the Cognitive Services, go to a QuickStart for each service.

### Running the code snippets

If you do want to run these snippets are are the steps. Choose the language and service you wish to run. Navigate to the corresponding folder and open the README.

## Samples vs snippets

*Samples* differ from these code snippets in that samples aim to provide users with code that more closely aligns with how the services might be used within an application. Samples should follow coding best practices and design. However, in the case of a library Quickstart or API reference, we need to to present easily digestible snippets of code--those few lines a developer can copy and paste to get their (single) task at hand completed.

Once they've completed the Quickstart, viewing a sample that presents a more integrated usage scenario can be quite valuable. It can help put into context the Quickstart's atomic snippets and API calls they've just learned about and executed, giving them an idea of how the library can be used in a larger application.

We offer samples for each language here:

- Cognitive Services Java SDK samples: <https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-java-sdk-samples>
- Cognitive Services Node.js SDK samples: <https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-node-sdk-samples>
- Cognitive Services Python SDK samples: <https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-python-sdk-samples>
